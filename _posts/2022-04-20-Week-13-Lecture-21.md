## Determinants

## 2x2 determinants

The determinant of a $$2\times 2$$ matrix is

$$\det\left[\begin{array}{cc}a & b\\c & d\end{array}\right] = ad-bc.$$

Remember that we can visualize the transformations of the $$x,y$$ plane that a $$2\times 2$$ matrix corresponds to.

* determinants of rotation matrices are $$1$$
* determinants of reflection matrices are $$-1$$
* determinants of expansion / compression matrices = new area of image of unit square

In general, for any $$2\times 2$$ matrix $$A$$,

$$\det(A) = \pm \text{area of image of unit square}$$

where the sign above is determined by whether or not the transformation changes the orientation of circles

### Calculating determinants

Determinants of larger $$n\times n$$ matrices are caculated via row or column expansion

$$\det(A) = \sum_{j=1}^n (-1)^ja_{1,j}\det(A_{1,j})$$

where here $$a_{i,j}$$ is the $$i,j$$'th entry of $$A$$ and $$A_{ij}$$ is the $$(n-1)\times (n-1)$$ matrix formed by removing the $$i$$'th row and $$j$$'th column from $$A$$.

### Properties of determinants

Let $$A$$ and $$B$$ be $$n\times n$$ matrices and $$c\in \mathbb C$$.

* $$\det(AB) = \det(A)\det(B)$$
* $$\det(AB) = \det(BA)$$
* $$\det(cA) = c^n\det(A)$$
* $$\det(A^{-1}) = 1/\det(A)$$ if $$A^{-1}$$ exists

### Determinants and linear systems

**Theorem:** Let $$A$$ be an $$n\times n$$ matrix and $$\vec b$$ a column vector of length $$n$$.  Then the following are equivalent

* the system of equations $$A\vec x = \vec b$$ has a unique solution
* the homogeneous system $$A\vec x = \vec 0$$ has only the trivial solution
* $$A$$ is invertible
* $$\det(A)\neq 0$$

### Cofactor matrices

The matrix of cofactors generalizes the formula for the inverse of a $$2\times 2$$ matrix.
