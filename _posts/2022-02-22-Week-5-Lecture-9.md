## Vectors

We describe the two-dimensional situation.  The three dimensional situation and higher are similar.

### Vector addition

### Magnitude of a vector

The magnitude of a vector $$\vec u = [u_1\ u_2]$$ is the length of the vector
$$\|\vec u\| = \sqrt{u_1^2 + u_2^2}.$$


## Example applications

We swim directly East at $$1$$ mph across a river which flows at $$5$$ mph directly South.  What is the resultant velocity and speed?
