## Adjacency matrices of graphs

If $$G$$ is a graph whose vertices are enumerated as $$v_1,v_2,\dots v_n$$, then the **adjacency matrix** of the graph is an $$n\times n$$ matrix $$A$$ whose $$j,k$$'th entry is $$1$$ if $$v_j$$ and $$v_k$$ are connected by an edge, and $$0$$ otherwise.

Of course, graphs can have many different adjacency matrices, depending on how we enumerate the vertices!

**Example:** 

Consider the following two graphs, both of which are obviously the same.

![pentagon graphs](/math107spring2023/extras/img/pentagon-graph.png)


The left graph has the adjacency matrix

$$\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1\\
1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0
\end{array}\right]$$

Whereas the right graph has the adjacency matrix

$$\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1\\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0
\end{array}\right]$$

This leads to an important basic question from graph theory: if the same graph can have different adjacency matrices, then what can the adjacency matrix actually say about a graph?

## Isomorphic graphs

One thing we can say right away is that certain graphs are more or less the same, even if they might look a bit different from their drawings.
In particular, if we can go from one graph to another by gradually moving their vertices and edges (without adding or removing connections), then we can consider the graphs the same in a certain sense.

Graph isomorphisms can be understood in terms of adjacency matrices.

**Definition:** Two graphs are called **isomorphic** if we can choose enumrations of the vertices such that both graphs have the same adjacency matrix.

Sometimes graphs can appear to be very different, but the isomorphism is still revealed by their adjacency matrices.

**Example:**

The following graphs describe a pentagon and a pentagram.  Geometrically, these are very different shapes.  However, the graph is all about what vertices are connected to other vertices.  As we see from the chosen enumerations below, each of the graphs have the same adjacency matrices, and are therefore isomorphic.

## Eigenvalues of graphs

It can be pretty hard in general to tell whether two graphs are isomorphic.  This is the so-called **Graph Isomorphism Problem**, which can become incredibly hard, as graphs become more complicated.

One way we can start to tell non-isomorphic graphs apart is by using their eigenvalues.
To define this, we start with an important observation.

**Theorem:** If $$A$$ and $$\widetilde{A}$$ are two adjacency matrices of the same graph, then $$A$$ and $$\widetilde{A}$$ have the same eigenvalues.

This makes the following definition of the eignvalues of a graph make sense.

**Definition:** The **eigenvalues of a graph** are the eigenvalues of an adjacency matrix of the graph.

Since the eigenvalues of a graph are independent of which adjacency matrix we get to represent it, and two graphs are isomorphic if we can find indexing of each with the same adjacency matrix, we know that isomophic graphs must have the same eigenvalues.

**Theorem:** If two graphs are isomorphic, then they must have the same eigenvalues.

Usually this result is used in its contrapositive form.

**Corollary:** If two graphs have different eigenvalues, then they cannot be isomorphic.

Careful!  The converse, isn't true.  If two graphs have the same eigenvalues, it is not necessarily true that they are isomorphic.  Thus calculating eigenvalues only provides a partial solution of the graph isomorphism problem.

## Diamater of graphs

As another example application of eigenvalues of graphs, we can consider the diameter of a graph, which is the largest distance between two vertices on a graph.

**Definition:** A **path** in a graph from a vertex $$v$$ to another vertex $$w$$ is a sequence of edges which start at $$v$$ and end at $$w$$.  The **length** of a path is the number of edges in the path.  The **distance** between two vertices is the length of the shortest path between the vertices.  Finally, the **diameter** of a graph is the largest distance between two vertices.

In other words, the diameter of a graph is the "largest shortest length", the maximum over pairs of vertices of the length of the shortest path between the vertices.

**Theorem:**

Let $$G$$ be a graph.  Then

$$\text{diameter of $G$} \leq \text{\# distinct eigenvalues} -1.$$
