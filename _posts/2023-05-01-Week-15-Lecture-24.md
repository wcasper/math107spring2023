## Today's Objectives

* Graphs
* Spectral Graph Theory

## Graphs

A graph is a collection of elements, called **vertices**, and a collection of lines connecting pairs of vertices, called **edges**.

In MATLAB a graph can be represented in terms of its **adjacency matrix**, a matrix $$A$$ satisfying

$$A_{jk} = \left\lbrace\begin{array}{cc}
1 & \text{vertices j and k are connected}\\
0 & \text{vertices j and k are not connected}
\end{array}\right.$$

## Important definitions

**Definition:** A **path** between two vertices in a graph is a sequence of edges which go from one vertex to another.  A graph is called **connected** if there is a path between any two vertices.

**Definition:** The **distance** between two vertices is the length of the shortest path between them.  The **diameter** of a graph is the distance between to vertices in the graph who are as far apart as possible.  

## Spectral graph theory

In mathematics, the term *spectral* refers to eigenvectors and eigenvalues, so spectral graph theory is how we can use the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix or other matrices like the adjacency matrix to study properties of the graph itself.

Some basic observations:

* The sum of the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix is $$0$$
* The product of the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix is the determinant
* As the diameter of the graph increases, the number of different eigenvalues we get also seems to increase...

**Question:**  Can we use the eigenvalues of the matrix to bound the diameter of the matrix?
