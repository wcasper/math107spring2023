Work out each of the following problems **by hand** and be sure to show your work.  Scan your written solutions and upload them as a **single** PDF.
Be sure to show your work!  Solutions without work will receive very little credit.

**Problem 1:**

For each of the transformations of the $$x,y$$-plane described below, find a $$2\times 2$$ matrix which performs the transformation.
* (a) a counter-clockwise rotation of the plane by $$45$$ degrees
* (b) a reflection across the line $$y = -x$$
* (c) first stretching in the $$y$$ direction and then reflecting across the line $$y=0$$

**Problem 2:**

For each of the following matrices, draw a picture of the associated transformation indicating specifically where the transformation sends the unit square.  Be sure to carefully indicate where each side and vertex is mapped to.
Finally describe the transformation in your own words.
* (a) $$\left(\begin{array}{cc}0 & -1\\ 1 & 0\end{array}\right)$$
* (b) $$\left(\begin{array}{cc}-2 & 0\\ 0 & -1\end{array}\right)$$

**Problem 3:**

Write each of the following complex numbers as $$a+ib$$ for some real numbers $$a$$ and $$b$$.
* (a) $$1/i$$
* (b) $$i^{-3}$$
* (c) $$i^5$$
* (d) $$i^{100}$$
* (e) $$-1/i^2$$

**Problem 4:**

Let $$z = 2 + 5i$$ and $$w = -1-3i$$.  Write each of the following expressions in $$a+ib$$ form.
* (a) $$zw$$
* (b) $$\overline ww$$
* (c) $$\frac{z}{w}$$
* (d) $$z - w$$
* (e) $$\lvert z\rvert$$

**Problem 5:**

Rewrite each of the following complex numbers in $$a+ib$$ form
* (a) $$e^{i\pi/2}$$
* (b) $$e^{-i\pi/2}$$
* (c) $$e^{4i\pi}$$

Rewrite each of the following complex numbers in $$re^{i\theta}$$ form.
* (d) $$1 + 2i$$
* (e) $$(1+2i)(2-i)$$


**Problem 6:**

* (a) Put the following matrix in RREF

$$\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
−2 & −3 & −2 & 1\\
 3 & −2 & −2 & 2\\
 3 & −2 & −1 & 0\\
−1 & −1 & −2 & 3
\end{array}\right].$$

* (b) Solve the following system of equations

$$\begin{align}
-2x -3y - 2z &= 1\\
 3x -2y - 2z &= 2\\
 3x -2y -  z &= 0\\
 -x - y - 2z &= 3
\end{align}$$
