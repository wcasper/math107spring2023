Our first task is to introduce ourselves to the rest of the class!  Use this opportunity to introduce yourself to your peers and maybe even find some study buddies to work with during the class.  To complete this assignment, follow these steps

1.  Sign up for Flipgrid using your Google or Microsoft account
2.  Join the Flipgrid group for this class using the following link [https://flipgrid.com/fc1043cf](https://flipgrid.com/fc1043cf) (Links to an external site.)
3.  Use the link [https://flipgrid.com/683b8d4b](https://flipgrid.com/683b8d4b) (Links to an external site.) to leave a video post introducing yourself and answering the following questions:
  *  Give your name and include any desired nickname or preferred name
  *  Give your major concentration and your year in school
  *  Say one thing you are worried about for this class and one thing you are excited for about this class!
  *  Briefly describe your programming experience.  If you've done any programming before, mention what languages you used

Once you have created your Flipgrid post, please watch at least two other posts from other students and provide a video or text comment.
