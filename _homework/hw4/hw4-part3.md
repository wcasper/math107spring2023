## Written Portion

Work out each of the following problems **by hand** and be sure to show your work.  Scan your written solutions and upload them as a **single** PDF.

**Problem 3:**

Let

$$\vec v = \binom{3}{5},\quad \vec w = \binom{-3}{6}$$

Plot by hand the following vectors

a) $$\vec v$$

b) $$\vec w$$

c) $$\vec v + \vec w$$

d) $$\vec v - \vec w$$


**Problem 4:**

Consider the following problems concerning matrices

a) If $$A$$ is a $$5\times 3$$ matrix and $$AB$$ is a $$5\times 7$$ matrix, what must be the dimensions of $$B$$? Explain.

b) If $$B$$ and $$C$$ are matrices and $$BC$$ is a $$3\times 4$$ matrix, what can we say for sure about the dimensions of $$B$$ and $$C$$?

c) Let 

$$
A = \left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 2\\
2 & 3
\end{array}\right),\quad
B = \left(\begin{array}{cc}
5 & 8\\
8 & x
\end{array}\right)
$$

Determine for which values of $$x$$ we have $$AB = BA$$.

d) Let 

$$
A = \left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 1\\
1 & 1
\end{array}\right),\quad
B = \left(\begin{array}{cc}
3  & 1\\
-1 & 1
\end{array}\right),\quad
C = \left(\begin{array}{cc}
4  & 2\\
-2 & 0
\end{array}\right)
$$

Show that $$AB = AC$$, even though $$B\neq C$$.
