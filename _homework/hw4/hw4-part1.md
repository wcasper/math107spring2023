## Matrix-valued functions

**Problem 1:**
Create a function called **xmatrix** which takes in an integer $$n$$ and returns an $$n\times n$$ matrix $$A$$ whose value is

$$A =
\left(\begin{array}{ccccccc}
1 & 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 & 0 & 1\\
0 & 1 & 0 & \dots & 0 & 1 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1 & \dots & 1 & 0 & 0\\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots\\
0 & 0 & 1 & \dots & 1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 0 & \dots & 0 & 1 & 0\\
1 & 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{array}\right)
$$

ie. ones one the main diagonal and anti-diagonal and zeros elsewhere.  Don't use any built-in functions for this, except for the function *zeros*.  Be sure to include good documentation in the file, including
