Write down your solutions to the following problems, then scan and upload them as a single pdf.

## Linear combinations

**Problem 1:**  Consider the matrices

$$
A = \left(\begin{array}{cc}
7 & -2\\
1 & 3
\end{array}\right)
\quad\text{and}\quad
B = \left(\begin{array}{cc}
2 &  1\\
4 & -1
\end{array}\right)$$

Compute by hand the following quantities

* A + 2B

* 2A - 3B

**Problem 2:**

* Find the values of scalars $$a$$ and $$b$$ satisfying

$$a\binom{1}{4} + b\binom{-2}{7} = \binom{8}{-13}$$

* Find the matrix $$X$$ satisfying

$$
2\left(\begin{array}{cc}
3 & -1\\ 2 & 5
\end{array}\right) + X
= \left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 7\\
3 & -4
\end{array}\right).$$
