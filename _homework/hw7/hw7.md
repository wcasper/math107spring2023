Work out each of the following problems **by hand** and be sure to show your work.  Scan your written solutions and upload them as a **single** PDF.
Be sure to show your work!  Solutions without work will receive very little credit.

**Problem 1:**

For each of the following matrices, calculate the matrix determinant by hand and carefully show your work.

* (a)

$$A = \left[
\begin{array}{cc}
2 & 3\\
1 & 2
\end{array}
\right]$$

* (b)

$$C = \left[
\begin{array}{cc}
0 & 1 & 2\\
1 & 0 &-1\\
2 & 1 & 3
\end{array}
\right]$$

**Problem 2:**

Determine the values of $$x$$ for which the following matrices are **singular**

* (a)

$$A = \left[
\begin{array}{cc}
2-x & 1\\
1 & 3-x
\end{array}
\right]$$

* (b)

$$B = \left[
\begin{array}{cc}
1-x & 1 &2\\
0 & 2-x &2\\
-1 &2 & 3-x
\end{array}
\right]$$

**Problem 3:**

Use **Cramer's rule** to find a solution of the linear system of equations

$$\left\lbrace\begin{array}{cc}
x + z &= 10\\
x + 2y + z &= 20\\
x + y + 3z &= 25\\
\end{array}\right.$$

**Problem 4:**

Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the following matrices

* (a)

$$A = \left[
\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 2\\
2 & 0
\end{array}
\right]$$

* (b)

$$B = \left[
\begin{array}{cc}
0 & 1 & 1\\
1 & 0 & 1\\
1 & 1 & 0
\end{array}
\right]$$
