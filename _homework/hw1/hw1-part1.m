%% Problem 1
% define your variables a,b,c below

%% Problem 2
% define your variables x,y,z,w, and q below

%% Problem 3

% define variable T_room and set it to the room temperature

% define variable T_0 and set it to the temperature of a living human

% define a variable r and set it equal to the specific heat capacitance

% define a variable T and set it equal to the temperature the body was discovered at

% now use the equation above to determine the time it took for the body to cool
% make sure to use the variable t for your result!!
