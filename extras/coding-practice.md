Maybe you are learning to code for the first time, or maybe you are challenging yourself to become a better coder.  Either way, the key is **practice practice practice**

One resource for additional practice and resources is the MATLAB Onramp, which is available for free from MATLAB Academy
* [Matlab Onramp](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/details/matlab-onramp/gettingstarted)

The basics of coding (variables, arrays, for loops, while loops, etc) are usually pretty similar.  This means you can level up your coding ability (and therefore your MATLAB ability) very quickly by practicing another language like Python.

There are several websites that gamify programming problems, giving you tons of practice with the feeling of "leveling up".  One example I personally love is
* [codewars](https://www.codewars.com) (external site)

Think of this site as a way to do a workout in a gym (but for coding).  It's a very fast, but challenging, way to grow.
