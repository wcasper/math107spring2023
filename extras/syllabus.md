**Office:** McCarthy Hall 160A

**Email:** wcasper@fullerton.edu

**Office hourse:** To be announced.  Additional office hours are always available by request.

**Course website:** we will use Canvas website (Spring 2023 MATH 107 Section 1 and 2), but will link additional information from a corresponding <a target="_parent" href="https://wcasper.github.io/math107spring2023">Github Pages site (link)</a> which you may find more convenient for pulling material.

## Course catalog description
This course is an introduction to linear algebra and computation with applications.  Linear algebra topics include Euclidean spaces, matrices and matrix arithmetic, solving systems of equations, and eigenvalues and eigenvectors.  Computation topics include variables, functions, conditionals, loops, and plotting.

**Course prerequisites:** None
Math 150A with a "C" (2.0) or better.

## Course objectives and learning goals
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
* manipulate matrices by hand and by using MATLAB, including performing matrix addition, multiplication, and row reduction
* interpret vectors, matrices, and complex numbers algebraically and geometrically
* find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices and explain some of their applications
* write introductory-level programs in MATLAB with an understanding of how to manipulate matrices, plot code, and write code that includes functions, loops, and conditional statements
* communicate mathematics to others and collaborate in teams to complete tasks

## Course Material
### Required Textbooks
There are **two** required texbooks for this course:

1. *When Life is Linear: From Computer Graphics to Bracketology* by Tim Chartier
2. Combined tet of *Fundamentals of Matrix Algebra* by Gregory Hartman and *An Introduction to MATLAB* by Troy Siemers 
The second textbook is available as a <a target="_parent" href="textbook.pdf">free PDF (link)</a>.

### Required technology
For this course, you will need to have access to technology that will allow you to join Zoom lectures, join Zoom office hours, view and upload assignments on Canvas, and create MATLAB programs.

* **HARDWARE:** an actual working laptop or personal computer with both a microphone and a webcam.  This class has a large programming component and **cell phones or tablets will not cut it**.  If you don't have the required hardware, see Technology requests below.
* **MATLAB:** MATLAB is a robust software package that is used by many scientists and engineers to model real-world phenomena.  You will be required to use MATLAB for in-class and homework assignments.  MATLAB is available for free to all CSUF students.  Visit the following <a target="_parent" href="https://wcasper.github.io/math107spring2022/extras/install-MATLAB">link about installing MATLAB</a>.  It is strongly suggested that you have a personal laptop or desktop computer on which you can install MATLAB and do assignments.
* **Canvas:** We will be using the Canvas Learning Management System for all course materials and communication.  See below for details.
* **Zoom:** For this course, you will need to have access to technology that will allow you to join Zoom for some lectures and office hours.
* **Internet:** You will require ongoing access to a computer with reliable internet connectivity for assignments and lectures

### Technology requests
If you do not have access to the necessary technology, you may be able to request a laptop, MiFi (wi-fi hotpot), and/or headset from the CSUF IT Department by filling out this <a target="_parent" href="https://apps.fullerton.edu/coviddevicerequest/Request.aspx">technology device request form (link)</a>.


### Software for students
You can get free and low-cost software for being an active CUSF student.  Software downloads and request forms can be found on the <a target="_parent" href="https://fullerton.edu/it/students/software/">CSUF student software website (link)</a>

## Grading
### Grading scheme

* Homework: 25%
* Quizzes/Lecturee Assessments: 15%
* Midterm Exams: 2 at 15% each
* Final Exam: 30%

Please note that **homework is worth a large part of your grade**.  Do your homework!  You can pass every exam and still fail the class if you don't bother to turn in your homework assignments.

### Grading scale (tentative)

The following is a **tentative** grading scale translating your percentage grade to a final letter grade in the class.  While the actual grading scale will be determined at the end of the semester, the grade you get will be **at least** the grade reflected in the scale below.

| Letter Grade | Pecentage |
| ------------ | --------- |
| A+ | 97-100  |
| A  | 93-96.9 |
| A- | 90-92.9 | 
| B+ | 87-89.9 | 
| B  | 83-86.9 |
| B- | 80-82.9 | 
| C+ | 77-79.9 | 
| C  | 70-76.9 | 
| D  | 60-69.9 | 
| F  |  0-59.9 |

## Policies and expectations
I reserve the right to adjust the policies in this syllabus on a case-by-case basis.

**E-mail**
Please email me from your CSU Fullerton account, as other email addresses may be filtered into my Spam folder.

Allow me 24 hours to respond to your email before sending a follow-up email. My response time may be slower in the evenings or over weekends.

**Attendance and Participation**
If you miss any classes during the first week without notifying the instructor or the departmental office within 24 hours of the meeting, you may be dropped from the course.

Attendance and class participation are important components for success in this course. We will work through assigned in-class problems during our meetings.

You will be expected to work in groups on in-class assignments. Be respectful, and make sure all team members have completed the task. The teamwork grade will be factored into the participation grade.

You may also be asked to post in the Discussion Board. Before doing so, review the Forum Rules on our Canvas course site.


**Quizzes and Assigned Readings**
You will be assigned a few sections of material to read prior to most class meetings. These are crucial for your understanding of the material in lectures and participation in in-class assignments.

Lecture assessments and quizzes will be provided through Canvas.
Students will be responsible for completing a lecture assessment of the previous lecture, due the night before the next lecture.

**Homework**
Homework assignments will feature both computational and analytic components.  For the former, the MATLAB code, all image files, any required screenshots, and any necessary written solutions for each assignment will need to be submitted through the course website on Canvas.
For the latter, you will need to provide a written solution which will be uploaded with any relevant code as a PDF document.  Three possible ways of accomplishing this include
* typing your solution in LaTeX on Overleaf and then compiling and downloading the resultant pdf.
* writing your solution and using a scanner or smartphone to scan it as a PDF document and upload it
* using some other word processor such as Microsoft Word to create the document and then export it as a PDF

## Exams
Exams will take place during class at the times stated below. You will log into the class Zoom session and take the exam during a specified time.  Note that you must have video with both your face and hands visible and a working speaker and microphone during the exam.  The microphone should be muted during test-taking in order to not disturb your peers.

If you have an accommodation from Disability Support Services (such as time-and-a-half), it is your responsibility to coordinate with the instructor before each exam.

**Midterm Exams**
There will be two midterm exams, each lasting 1 hour and 50 minutes.
Each midterm will be worth 15\% of your final grade.
Midterms will be held during class time in our Zoom meeting on the following dates:
* Wednesday, March 1, 2023
* Wednesday, April 12, 2023

**Final Exam**

## Academic integrity
Students who violate university standards of academic integrity are subject to disciplinary sanctions, including failure in the course and suspension from the university. Since dishonesty in any form harms the individual, other students, and the university, policies on academic integrity are strictly enforced. Examples of academic dishonesty include, but are not limited to:
1. copying from another student's homework, quiz, or exam;
2. allowing another student to copy your work; and
3. copying homework solutions from online.

You should familiarize yourself with the academic integrity guidelines found in the current student handbook.  Consult the <a target="_parent" href="http://www.fullerton.edu/senate/publications_policies_resolutions/ups/UPS%20300/UPS%20300.021.pdf">University Policy Statement (UPS) 300.021 regarding Academic Dishonesty (link)</a> for details.
