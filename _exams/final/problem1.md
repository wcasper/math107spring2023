## Problem 1

The $$n$$'th Fourier truncation of a **sawtooth function** is given by

$$T_n(x) = 1 + \frac{1}{\pi}\cos(x) + \frac{1}{2\pi}\cos(2x) + \frac{1}{3\pi}\cos(3x) + \dots + \frac{1}{n\pi}\cos(nx).$$

Write a function called *sawsum(x,n)* which takes in a real number $$x$$ and an integer $$n$$ and returns the value of $$T_n(x)$$ according to the above formula.

Make sure to properly document your code!
Upload your function as a MATLAB .m file.  You may wish to run and test your code using MATLAB before you upload it.
