## Problem 2

Given any integers $$m$$ and $$n$$, the MATLAB command *mod(m,n)* will return $$0$$ if $$n$$ divides $$m$$.  Otherwise it will return something nonzero.
Create a function called *evenness(m)* which takes in an integer $$m$$ and uses a *while* loop to determine the number of times $$2$$ divides $$m$$.

For example, *evenness(3)* should return $$0$$, *evenness(14)* should return $$1$$, and *evenness(24)* should return $$3$$.

Make sure to properly document your code!
Upload your function as a MATLAB .m file.  You may wish to run and test your code using MATLAB before you upload it.
