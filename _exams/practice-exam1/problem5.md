## Problem 5

For this problem, consider the matrix

$$L = \left(\begin{array}{ccc}
  0 &  7 & -1\\
 10 &  2 & 11\\
 -4 & -7 &  2\\
 12 &  0 & 43\\
 -3 & -2 &  8
\end{array}\right)$$

a) Write down the value of L(4,2)

b) Write down an MATLAB expression which will create the $$3\times 2$$ submatrix of $$L$$ obtained by deleting the first column and both the first and last rows.

c) Write down the value of the matrix $$L(1:2:end,1:2:end)$$
