## Problem 1

a) Create a variable $$w$$ which is a row vector whose entries are all the even integers between $$-310$$ and $$450$$ in ascending order.

b) Create a variable $$q$$ whose first element is $$-15$$, whose last element is $$29$$ and whose entries are $$1000$$ evenly spaced elements in ascending order.

c) Create a variable $$A$$ whose value is equal to the matrix

$$A = \left(\begin{array}{cccc}
1 & 3 & 4 & 2\\
7 & 1 & 2 & 2\\
9 & 8 & 7 & 6
\end{array}\right).$$

d) Use the MATLAB commands

```Matlab
rng(1234);
M = randi(9,10,10);
J = randi(3,10,3);
```

to create a particular $$10\times 10$$ matrix $$M$$ and another $$10\times 3$$ matrix $$J$$.  Then create a $$10\times 13$$ matrix $$K$$ whose value is the horizontal concatenation of $$M$$ and $$J$$, with $$J$$ on the right.

e) Create a matrix $$N$$ by first setting $$N=M$$ and then setting all of the entries of $$N$$ which are less than $$5$$ equal to $$0$$.
