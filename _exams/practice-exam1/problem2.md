## Problem 2

a) Create a row vector $$x$$ whose first entry is $$-1$$, whose last entry is $$1$$, and whose entries increase in increments of $$0.01$$

b) Define variables *y1*, *y2*, and *y3* by

$$\begin{align}
y1 &= x\exp(-x^2)\\
y2 &= x(1-x^2)\\
y3 &= x - x^3 + \frac{1}{2}x^5
\end{align}$$

c) On the same plot, plot the curves *y1*, *y2*, and *y3* as functions of $$x$$ (i.e., the horizontal axis should represent values of *x* and the vertical axis should represent values of the functions).  Use different colors and line styles for each curve.

d) Label the horizontal axis as *x* and the vertical axis as *y*, and add a legend to your plot.

**Note:** All the commands used to create the figure must be included in the script file that gets submitted.  Commands that are not included will not receive credit.
