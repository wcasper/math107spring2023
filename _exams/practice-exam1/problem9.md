## Problem 9

The number **$$n$$ factorial**, denoted $$n!$$, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to $$n$$

$$n! = 1\cdot 2\cdot 3\cdot\dots\cdot (n-1)\cdot n.$$

Without using any built-in MATLAB functions, Write down a function called *factorial* which takes in an integer $$n$$ and returns $$n!$$.
You should do this by hand on a piece of paper.  Make sure that your function is well-documented!
