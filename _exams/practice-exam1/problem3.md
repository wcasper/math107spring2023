## Problem 3

The volume of a cone of radius $$r$$ and height $$h$$ is 

$$V = \frac{1}{3}\pi r^2h$$

and the surface area is given by

$$S = \pi r\left(r + \sqrt{r^2 + h^2}\right).$$

a) Create a function called *cone_volume* whose input is the radius *r* and the height *h* and whose output is the volume of the associated cone.  Be sure to carefully and appropriately document your function.
