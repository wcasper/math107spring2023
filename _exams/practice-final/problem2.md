## Problem 2

The $$n$$'th **harmonic number** is defined to be

$$h_n = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + \dots + \frac{1}{n}.$$

Write a function called *harmless(x)* which takes in a real number $$x>1$$ and uses a while loop to calculate the greatest harmonic number $$h_n$$ less than $$x$$.  Your function shoudl return the harmonic number.
Make sure to properly document your code.
