## Problem 4


Write a MATLAB script that uses the least squares approximation to find a polynomial

$$y = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx  + d$$

of degree three which most closely fits the following data

| x |  y  |
| - | --- |
| 1 |   0 |
| 2 |   2 |
| 3 |   9 |
| 4 |  26 |
| 5 |  65 | 
| 6 | 124 | 

Your script should explicitly set the variables $$a,b,c,d$$ to be the coefficients above.
