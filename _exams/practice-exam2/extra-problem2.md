## Problem 2

The $$n$$'th **truncated Weierstrass factorization** of $$\sin(\pi x)$$ is given by

$$p(x,n) = \pi x \left(1-\left(\frac{x}{1}\right)^2\right)\left(1-\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^2\right)\left(1-\left(\frac{x}{3}\right)^2\right)\dots\left(1-\left(\frac{x}{n}\right)^2\right)$$

Create a function called *sinWeierstrass(x,n)* which takes in a number $$x$$ and an integer $$n$$ and returns $$p(x,n)$$ according to the equation above.  Be sure to carefully document your function.
