## Problem 2

If $$a$$ and $$q$$ are numbers and $$n>0$$ is any integer, then the $$q$$-**pochhammer symbol** is the product

$$(a;q)_n = (1-aq)(1-aq^2)(1-aq^3)\dots(1-aq^{n-1}).$$

Create a function called *qpoch(a,q,n)* which takes in the values $$a$$, $$q$$, and $$n$$, and returns the value of the $$q$$-pochhamer symbol $$(a;q)_n$$, which you calculate by using a single *for loop*.
