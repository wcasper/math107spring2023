## Problem 1

Create a function called *has_real_roots(a,b,c)* which takes in the coefficients $$a, b$$ and $$c$$ of the quadratic polynomial

$$p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$$

and returns $$1$$ if the roots of $$p(x)$$ are both real and $$0$$ otherwise.

So for example *has_real_roots(1,0,1)* should return $$0$$ but *has_real_roots(1,0,-1)* should reteurn $$1$$.
**Be sure to carefully document your function.**

Hint: remember that the roots of $$p(x)$$ are given by the quadratic formula

$$x = \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.$$
