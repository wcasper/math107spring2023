## Problem 3

The **skew-symmetric component** of an $$n\times n$$ matrix $$A$$ is the matrix $$B$$ whose $$(j,k)$$'th entry is given by

$$B(j,k) = \frac{1}{2}A(j,k) - \frac{1}{2}A(k,j).$$

Create a function called *skewMAT(A)* which takes in an $$n\times n$$ matrix $$A$$ and uses a double for loop to return the skew-symmetric component $$B$$ of $$A$$.
Be sure to carefully document your function.
