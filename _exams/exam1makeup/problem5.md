## Problem 5

On one particular trip, the velocity of a boat at time $$t$$ is given by

$$\text{velocity at $t$} = \left\lbrace\begin{array}{cc}
1      & t \leq 0\\
5t+1   & 0 < t\leq 5\\
25     & 5 < t\leq 7\\
25-3t  & 7 < t \leq 8\\
1 & t>8
\end{array}\right.$$


Create a function called *boat_velocity* which takes in the time *t* and returns the velocity of the boat at that particular time.  Make sure to include appropriate documentation!
