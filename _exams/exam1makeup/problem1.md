## Problem 1

Write a MATLAB script (m-file) which performs the following actions.
Be sure to carefully comment your code.

a) Create a variable $$x$$ which is a row vector whose entries are $$55$$ evenly spaced entries from $$-2$$ to $$3$$ (including $$-2$$ and $$3$$) in increasing order.

b) Create a variable $$p$$ whose entries are the even integers between $$0$$ and $$1000$$, ie. $$p= [0\ 2\ 4\ \dots\ 1000]$$.

c) Create a variable $$A$$ whose value is equal to the matrix

$$A = \left(\begin{array}{ccccc}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
0 & 2 & 0 & 2 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 3 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 2 & 0 & 2 & 0\\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
\end{array}\right).$$

d) Use the MATLAB commands

```Matlab
Z = zeros(2,5);
```

to create a particular $$2\times 5$$ matrix whose entries are all zero.  Then 

Then create a $$9x9$$ matrix $$Q$$ by appending $$Z$$ both to the top and to the bottom of the matrix $$A$$ from the previous problem.

e) Create a matrix $$F$$ by first setting $$F=A$$ and then setting all of the entries of $$F$$ which are $$0$$ equal to $$4$$.
