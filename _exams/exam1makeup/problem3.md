## Problem 3

Write a MATLAB script (m-file) which does the following.

a) Create a row vector $$x$$ whose first entry is $$0$$, whose last entry is $$2$$, and whose entries increase in increments of $$0.005$$

b) Define variables *y1* and *y2* by

$$\begin{align}
y1 &= \cos(x)\\
y2 &= 1 -\frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{24}x^4\\
\end{align}$$

c) On the same plot, plot the curves *y1* and *y2* as functions of $$x$$ (i.e., the horizontal axis should represent values of *x* and the vertical axis should represent values of the functions).  Use different colors and line styles for each curve.

d) Label the horizontal axis as *x* and the vertical axis as *y*, and add a legend to your plot which labels the first curve as "sine" and the second curve as "fourth Taylor".

**Note:** All the commands used to create the figure must be included in the script file that gets submitted.  Commands that are not included will not receive credit.
