## Problem 4

The volume of a cone of radius $$r$$ and height $$h$$ is given by

$$V = \frac{1}{3}\pi r^2h$$

and the surface area is given by

$$S = \pi r(r + \sqrt{r^2+h^2})$$

Create a function called *cone_stuff* whose inputs are the radius *r* and the height *h* (in that order) and whose output is *both* the volume and the surface area.
Be sure to carefully and appropriately document your function.
