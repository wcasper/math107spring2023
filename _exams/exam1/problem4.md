## Problem 4

The quadratic formula says that the solutions of the quadratic equation

$$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$

are given by

$$x_1 = \frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.$$

as well as

$$x_2 = \frac{-b - \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.$$

a) Create a function called *quadratic_root* whose inputs are the coefficients *a*, *b*, and *c* (in that order) and whose output is *both* of the  root specified above.
Be sure to carefully and appropriately document your function.

b) Submit your function online and also include a copy of the file *quadratic_root.m* with the rest of your submission files.
