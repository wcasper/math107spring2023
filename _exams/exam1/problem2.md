## Problem 2

In this problem we will test image manipulation.  You will be required to read in an image called *pikachu.jpg* which you can download here

* [pikachu.jpg](pikachu.jpg)

Make sure that you download this image and put it into your MATLAB working directory.  Then write a MATLAB script (m-file) which does the following:

a) Read the image *pikachu.jpg* into a matrix called *A*.

b) Create a variable called *nrows* whose value is the number of rows in the matrix *A*.  Likewise, create a variable called *ncols* whose value is the number of columns of *A*.

c) Create a variable called *npixels* whose value is the total number of pixels in the matrix *A*

d) Create a variable called *redness* whose value is the amount of red in the RGB value of the $$(33,22)$$ pixel of *A*

e) Create a matrix *Agray* containing the grayscale version of *A* using the usual conversion command

f) Create a downsampled version of *A* called *Asmall*, whose value is the same as *A* but with every even row and every even column thrown out
