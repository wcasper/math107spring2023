## Directions

This is a self-guided **group worksheet**.  Work with your group members to follow the instructions below and explore!  Note that some of the results will be assessed later, so make sure you do it right!

## Image Compression via SVD

In this worksheet, we will see how SVD can be used to perform image compression.
Image compression is the process of reducing the file size of an image, while trying to maintain the quality of the image.

Start with the image

![Shocked pikachu](/math107spring2022/extras/img/pikachu.jpg)

Download this image and include it in your working MATLAB directory.
Then read it in as a grayscale image via the command

```Matlab
A = rgb2gray(imread("pikachu.jpg"));
```

Now we use the following MATLAB code to calculate the SVD of the matrix $$A$$.

```Matlab
A = double(A);
[V,F] = eig(transpose(A)*A);
[U,E] = eig(A*transpose(A));
D = U'*A*V;
```

At this point $$D$$ should be a diagonal matrix.  We can double-check this by plotting it

```
imshow(uint8(D))
```

You should notice that the only non-black enries in the image will occur on the diagonal.
Note that we have to convert $$D$$ to a matrix with the appropriate data type for MATLAB to plot it correctly.


### Compressing the image

At this point the SVD contains **more** data than the original image, so we've done a terrible job of compressing it.
The actual compression routine comes from tossing out eigenvalues (and eigenvectors) which don't contribute that much to the image.
We can experiment this by creating a matrix $$E$$ which is the same as $$D$$ but with some of the entries zeroed out.

For example, the following code sets $$E$$ to be $$D$$, but with the first $$500$$ entries zeroed out.

```Matlab
E = D;
E(1:650,1:650) = 0;
```

Since the number of eigenvectors is $$657$$, this means we only have to actually remember and "store" seven eigenvectors, rather than the $$657$$ eigenvectors we started with, dramatically reducing the required image size.  As we see however, this is a bit drastic and the image quality suffers because of it.  Use the following code to plot the value of $$UEV^T$$, and see the value of the image using just the top seven largest eigenvectors.

```Matlab
imshow(uint8(U*E*transpose(V)));
```

A better idea might be to keep a few more eigenvectors, sacrificing a bit of the image compression in return for increased image quality.  Let's try to keep the top $$57$$ eigenvectors by using the command

```Matlab
E = D;
E(1:600,1:600) = 0;
```

Now again plot the resulting compressed image using the command

```Matlab
imshow(uint8(U*E*transpose(V)));
```

As you can see, we still have some obvious image artifacts, so we may want to keep even more eigenvectors.  If we keep the top $$157$$ eigenvectors using the command

```Matlab
E = D;
E(1:500,1:500) = 0;
```

and then plot it as before, we should see that the artifacts are no longer clearly visible to the eye.  At the same time, we've reduced the number of eigenvectors that we have to remember by a large factor, meaning we can store this image using much less storage space.
